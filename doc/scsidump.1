.SH DESCRIPTION
.B scsidump
has two modes of operation: dump and restore. These can be used with physical storage media, including hard drives and magneto optical drives. Dump mode can be used with read-only media such as CD/DVD drives.

When operating in dump mode, scsidump will copy all data from a remote SCSI drive to an image on the local filesystem. If enabled, it will also generate a .properties file that can be used to more closely emulate the source drive.

If you are operating in restore mode, scsidump will copy the data from a local binary image to a remote physical SCSI drive. The remote SCSI drive MUST be writable. 

.SH NOTES

.B scsidump
requires either a direct connection (one without transceivers) or a FULLSPEC PiSCSI/RaSCSI board.

If the generated drive image is intended to be used with PiSCSI, the drive image should be moved by the user to ~/images (or the location specified to the piscsi service).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-t\fI " "\fIID[:LUN]
SCSI ID and optional LUN of the remote SCSI device. The remote SCSI device will be functioning as the "Target" device.
.TP
.BR \-i\fI " "\fIBID
SCSI ID of the PiSCSI device. If not specified, the PiSCSI device will use ID 7. The PiSCSI host will be functioning as the "Initiator" device.
.TP
.BR \-f\fI " "\fIFILE
Path to the dump file. Not required when dumping to the stdout and no property file is requested.
.TP
.BR \-b\fI " "\fIBUFFER_SIZE
The transfer buffer size, specified in bytes. Default is 1 MiB. This is specified in bytes with a minimum value of 65536 (64 KiB).
.TP
.BR \-L\fI " "\fILOG_LEVEL
The scsidump log level (trace, debug, info, warning, error, off). The default log level is 'info'. Logging is alwqys disabled when dumping to stdout.
.TP
.BR \-a\fI
When scanning the bus scan all potential LUNs. Defaults to only scanning LUN 0.
.TP
.BR \-r\fI
Run in restore mode. Defaults to dump mode if not specified.
.TP
.BR \-p\fI
Generate a .properties file that is compatible with the PiSCSI web interface. The output filename will match the image filename with ".properties" appended. The generated file should be moved to ~/.config/piscsi.
.TP
.BR \-s\fI
Scan SCSI bus for devices.
.TP
.BR \-I\fI " "\fIID[:LUN]
Display INQUIRY data of ID[:LUN].

.SH EXAMPLES
Dump Mode: [SCSI Drive] ---> [PiSCSI host]
Launch scsidump to dump an all data from SCSI ID 3 with block size 64 KiB, store it to the local filesystem as a drive image named outimage.hda, and generate the outimage.hda.properties file with the drive's INQUIRY information:
   scsidump -t 3 -f ./outimage.hda -s 65536 -p

Restore Mode: [PiSCSI host] ---> [SCSI Drive]
Launch scsidump to restore/upload a drive image from the local file system to SCSI ID 0 with block size 1MiB:
   scsidump -r -t 0 -f ./outimage.hda -s 1048576
